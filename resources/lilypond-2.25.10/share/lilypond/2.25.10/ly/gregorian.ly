% Declare default layout; here for Vaticana style.  In case there will
% be additional styles, we may want to create style-specific `.ly` files
% for inclusion (e.g., `vaticana-init.ly`), move the style-dependent stuff
% over there, leave the style-independent Gregorian stuff here, and let
% the style-specific file (`vaticana-init.ly`) include this file.  The
% user then will have to include `vaticana-init.ly` instead of
% `gregorian.ly`.
